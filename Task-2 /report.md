## 📝 Sample Phishing Email

**From:** Microsoft Security Notifications `<alert@microsoft-support.com>`  
**To:** [you@example.com](mailto:you@example.com)  
**Subject:** [Action Required] Unusual sign-in activity detected on your Microsoft account

**Body:**
> Hello [Your Name],
>
> Our automated security systems detected unusual sign-in activity on your Microsoft 365 account from a new device or location.
>  
> For your protection, we've temporarily restricted your account. Please review the recent activity and confirm your identity to restore full access.  
>  
> [Review Recent Activity]  
>
> **Action required within 48 hours to avoid permanent account restriction.**  
>
> Learn how to keep your account safe at [Microsoft Security Tips]
>
> Sincerely,  
> Microsoft Account Protection Team

**Visible link:**  
`https://account.microsoft.com/recent-activity`  

**Actual link target:**  
`https://secure.microsoft-support.com/account-verification?id=6539821`  

**Attachment:**  
`Security_Notice.pdf` (malicious, do not open)

---

## 1️⃣ Sender Email Address (Spoofing Check)

- Display name: `Microsoft Security Notifications`
- Actual sender domain: `microsoft-support.com` *(not the true Microsoft domain!)*  
- Real organizations use official domains (e.g., `@microsoft.com`).

✅ **Red flag:** Spoofed email address, misleading display name.

---

## 2️⃣ Email Header Discrepancies

How to check:
- Open the email and locate "Show original" / "View headers" in your mail client.
- Copy the full header text.
- Paste into:
    - [MxToolbox Email Header Analyzer](https://mxtoolbox.com/EmailHeaders.aspx)
    - [mailheader.org](https://mailheader.org)

Check for:
- `Received:` lines show routing via unrelated mail servers
- `Return-Path` ≠ `From` domain
- SPF/DKIM/DMARC failures and mismatch
- Sender IP location doesn't match official org

✅ **Red flag:** Authentication failures, routing inconsistencies.

---

## 3️⃣ Suspicious Links or Attachments

- **Shown URL:** `https://account.microsoft.com/recent-activity`
- **Actual URL:** `https://secure.microsoft-support.com/account-verification?id=6539821`
- **Attachment:** `Security_Notice.pdf` (potentially malicious!)

Checking tips:
- Hover links, never click—do real and shown addresses match?
- Use [VirusTotal](https://virustotal.com) or [URLVoid](https://www.urlvoid.com/) to scan suspicious domains and files.

✅ **Red flag:** Mismatched URL and malicious attachment.

---

## 4️⃣ Urgent or Threatening Language

Phrases include:
- “Unusual sign-in activity”
- “Temporarily restricted”
- “Action required within 48 hours”
- “Permanent account restriction”

✅ **Red flag:** Emotional pressure and urgency to act quickly.

---

## 5️⃣ Mismatched URLs

| Shown Text                                   | Real Destination                                                  |
|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `https://account.microsoft.com/recent-activity` | `https://secure.microsoft-support.com/account-verification?id=6539821` |

✅ **Red flag:** Legitimate-looking text linked to a phishing page.

---

## 6️⃣ Spelling or Grammar Errors

- No obvious spelling mistakes (well-crafted attacks exist!).
- Slightly generic greeting ("Hello [Your Name]").
- Watch for awkward phrasing or formatting issues.

✅ **Note:** Not all phishing emails have errors—check tone and details.
